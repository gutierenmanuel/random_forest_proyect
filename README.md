# Improved Diabetes Prediction with Random Forest


This project aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. Initially, a Decision Tree model was employed, but significant improvements were achieved by transitioning to a Random Forest model in this repository: https://github.com/gutierenmanuel/decission_tree_proyect . The dataset used for experimentation is focused on diabetes-related features.
